1	Careful observation is required when 111 is administered concurrently with 222 .
1	Special consideration should be given to the administration of 111 in patients receiving 222 or other drugs that could cause or potentiate hypotension.
2	When 111 HCl is administered concomitantly with an 222 , the risk of hyperkalemia may be increased.
1	111 generally should not be given with 222 because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.

0	In vitro, 111 does not displace tightly bound drugs like phenytoin , propranolol , and 222 from serum proteins.
2	However, there has been one report of prolonged prothrombin time when 111 was added to the regimen of a patient treated with 222 .
3	In vitro, 111 may displace less firmly bound drugs like 222 .

2	The hypoglycemic effect of 111 has been reported to increase when 222 is given concurrently.
2	Fulminant rhabdomyolysis has been seen as early as three weeks after initiation of combined therapy with another 111 and 222 but may be seen after several months.
2	For these reasons, it is felt that, in most subjects who have had an unsatisfactory lipid response to either drug alone, the possible benefits of combined therapy with 111 and a 222 do not outweigh the risks of severe myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure.
